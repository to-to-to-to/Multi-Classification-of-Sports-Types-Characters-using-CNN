# About This Project

In this project, I want to predict the Data from 100 sports image classification from
kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/sports-classification) using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset contains of collection 
of sports images covering 100 different sports.The Images are 
[224,224,3] jpg format. 
Data is separated into train, test and valid directories.

# CNN In A Nutshell

A Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN or ConvNet, is a class of neural networks that specializes in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. A digital image is a binary representation of visual data. It contains a series of pixels arranged in a grid-like fashion that contains pixel values to denote how bright and what color each pixel should be.

# How to Access/Re-run This Project

1. Due to large size dataset, please download it first through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/sports-classification)

2. After that put the dataset into your directory and change it into your location in this line codes   
```bash
train = 'datasets/train'
test = 'datasets/test'
valid = 'datasets/valid'
```

3. run it. enjoy!
